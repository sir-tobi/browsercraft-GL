# BrowserCraft
Browsercraft is an attempt to create an oldschool real time strategy game to the browser. The game will be set up in a fantasy genre and feature typical RTS elements such as ressource management, unit creation, building cities and fighting with armies. The game will be controled via mouse and keyboard. It will be playable in any browser supporting HTML5.

For the initial setup the game will be a single player game with the opportunity to play versus AI. As for the graphics Warcraft 2 files will be used until own graphics are created.

### Technology
Browsercraft is built using plain JavaScript and the html canvas-element.
